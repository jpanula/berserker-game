"Too Angry to Die" is an action game, in which the player fights hoards of colourful slimes. Upon taking lethal damage the player is transformed into a huge angry beast with a time limit. To return to their original state the player must kill a certain amount of slimes before time runs out. If the beast dies or fails to transform back, the game ends.

Use WASD to move, the mouse to aim and left click to attack.
